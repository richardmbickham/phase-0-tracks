# Git Definitions

Rich is making some changes for Week 1 assignment 1.5

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
a system that documents changes in a file over time. It's useful because one can always revert back to a previous version for reference (it records each step along the way)

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
it's a copy of the original file from a repository that one can make changes on (and later merge)

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a revision to the cloned branched version that is 'saved.' A good commit message is a clear and specific summary of the changes made  

* What is a merge conflict?
it's conflicting code of 2 different branches that needs to be resolved. One way this happens is if 2 branhes have changed the same part of the same file. Another way is when 1 person is editing a file and another person deletes that file in their branch.
